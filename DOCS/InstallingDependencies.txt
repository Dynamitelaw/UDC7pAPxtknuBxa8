Setup Tensorflow Backend
=================================
--------------------
GPU Version
--------------------
Step 1) Update NVIDIA drivers (if you updated recently, you probably don't need to do this)

Step 2) Download and run the CUDA Toolkit installer
    https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.0.176_win10-exe
    *NOTE: Make sure you install v9.0

Step 3) Install cuDNN
    Download the library files
        If you want to jump through NVIDIA hoops -> https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
        Or if you don't -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MUAYs1lM1ED7jqRV0A9XRvvSMSq6AX9o/view?usp=sharing
        *NOTE: Make sure you get v9.0
    Unzip the cuDNN package.
    Copy the following files into the CUDA Toolkit directory.
        Copy <installpath>\cuda\bin\cudnn64_7.dll to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin.
        Copy <installpath>\cuda\ include\cudnn.h to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\include.
        Copy <installpath>\cuda\lib\x64\cudnn.lib to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\lib\x64.
    Set the following environment variables to point to where cuDNN is located. To access the value of the $(CUDA_PATH) environment variable, perform the following steps:
        GOTO Control Panel->System and Security->System->Advanced System Settings
        Click Environment Variables at the bottom of the window.
        Ensure the following values are set:
            Variable Name: CUDA_PATH 
            Variable Value: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0

            *NOTE: If Tensorflow cannot find the location of a dll file, also add the following entry to your Path table
            C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin

Step 4) Install Tensorflow
    pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

Step 5) Verify installation by trying to import tensorflow in a python cmd window
    *NOTE: Make sure to open the cmd window AFTER you setup your path variables, otherwise they won't be updated
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    >>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
    >>> sess = tf.Session()
    >>> print(sess.run(hello))

CPU Version
--------------------
Step 1) Install Tensorflow
    pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

Step 2) Verify installation by trying to import tensorflow in a python cmd window
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    >>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
    >>> sess = tf.Session()
    >>> print(sess.run(hello))


=================================
Setup Keras Frontend
=================================
Step 1) Install package
    pip install keras

Step 2) Verify package installation by trying to import Keras in a python cmd window
    The printout after the import should end with "Using TensorFlow backend."
